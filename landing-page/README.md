# Landing Page Project

It's a multi-section page.
The goal is to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one.

# Table of Contents

1. I added section four to index.html file
2. I changed (section.your-active-class) background color gradient in styles.css
3. I added code in app.js to make:

Navigation:
Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

Section Active State:
It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

Scroll to Anchor:
When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

# Instructions
